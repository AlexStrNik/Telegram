## Miserable Fucking Attempt at the Android Contest 2025, Round 1

<details>
  <summary>Open at your own risk</summary>
– Fuck Android, stupid piece of Open (not really, these days) Source Shit
– Fuck this outdated, undocumented shitpile of a codebase that only compiles on x64 Ubuntu for some reason, and a 14-KLOC-responsible-for-everything Activity
– Fuck Google for not releasing their tools for ARM versions of Linux, just because their laziness is greater than the number of grains of sand in a fucking desert. And yeah, what the fuck are you even trying to emulate on Linux, huh? The host system has the same arch as the emulated image, you idiots. Go learn something new, maybe steal from Apple and pretend you were first. Oh wait, you need a modified Java VM to run apps. Never mind.
– Fuck Java (and everything that contains “Java” either in source code or name, yeah, you too, JavaScript)
– Fuck Google one more time, with their brain-dead package system, randomly crashing emulator, monstrously laggy IDE, and stupid decisions in almost every API
– Fuck Ubuntu, which cannot work out-of-the-box. Yeah, rent a server and spend another hour installing DEs, servers, tools, Flatpak, Snap, whatever — just to run some fucking IDE
– Fuck VNC, which cannot work with GPU without fucking with virtual OpenGL adapters, xvfb, and other creatures from hell.
– Fuck Linux for the “fuck Nvidia” attitude — yeah, let’s just not support 80% of GPUs because proprietary drivers hurt your open-source feelings.
– Fuck Selectel (VPS provider), who thinks it’s okay to block your server for almost half an hour because you ran out of credit by two fucking dollars
– Fuck Google again, for not forcing lazy-ass Android developers to update codebases at least once per century (Apple forces it every year by raising the minimum Xcode version)
– And finally, fuck this Contest. Yeah, I get it — no third-party libs. But no Kotlin in 2025? Like what the actual fuck? Just why..
